\arguments{
\item{m}{expression matrix (genes by cells)}

\item{sigs}{list of gene signatures}

\item{center.fun}{optional centering function to apply to matrix before scoring. Default: NULL}

\item{center.rows}{whether to center rows in sigScores. Default: TRUE}

\item{expr.bin.m}{optional expression bin matrix for sigScores. Default: NULL}

\item{N}{number of permutations to generate null distribution. Default: 50}

\item{alternative}{test direction: 'greater' (high scores), 'two.sided' (extreme scores in either direction), or 'less' (low scores). Default: 'greater'}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to sigScores}
}
\value{
data frame with columns: id (cell), sig (signature name), score (observed score), fdr (adjusted p-value)
}
\description{
Computes signature scores for observed data and compares against N permuted null distributions. For each permutation, gene expression values are shuffled across cells (independently for each gene) to break co-expression patterns while preserving gene identities and expression distributions. Identifies cells with significantly high (or low) signature scores based on permutation testing. Scores are considered significant if they exceed mean + 2*SD (or fall below mean - 2*SD) of the permuted distribution.
