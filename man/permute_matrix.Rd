\title{Permute matrix by shuffling across cells}
\usage{
permute_matrix(m, MARGIN = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{matrix (genes by cells)}

\item{MARGIN}{1 for rows (shuffles across cells for each gene), 2 for columns. Default: 1}
}
\value{
permuted matrix with same dimensions and names as input
}
\description{
Shuffles expression values across cells independently for each gene (row). Preserves gene identities and expression distributions while breaking co-expression patterns within cells. Used to generate null distributions for permutation testing.
